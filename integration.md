#Apache Shiro Integrations

Shiro has been downloaded over one million times and is in production at thousands of companies. One reason: it integrates well with other technologies and frameworks. 


## Officially Supported Integrations
These integrations are supported by the Apache Shiro Development team. Want to help make them great? [Contribute](how-to-contribute.html) back to the project!

* **[Spring Application Framework](spring.html)** Integrate Shiro into standalone or web-based Spring applications.

* **[Guice Dependency Injection Framework](guice.html)** For Guice-based applications using standard Guice conventions and mechanisms.

* **[CAS SSO server](cas.html)** Protect your WebApp with a Jasig CAS SSO server. 


##Open Source Community Integrations

* **[Stormpath User Management](http://www.stormpath.com/blog/user-management-java-web-apps-stormpath-and-apache-shiro)** from [Stormpath](http://www.stormpath.com/)
Pairing Apache Shiro with Stormpath gives you a full application security and user management system, with little to no coding.

* **[Grails](http://grails.org/plugins/shiro)** from [Pivotal](http://grails.org/) and [@pledbrook](https://twitter.com/@pledbrook)
Very up-to-date Grails/Shiro Integration, including Grails 2.0 and Shiro 1.2. Adds easy authentication and access control to Grails applications. 

* **[Oauth](https://github.com/FeedTheCoffers/shiro-oauth)** from [@JimmiDyson](https://twitter.com/@JimmiDyson)
Source code for an OAuth module for Apache Shiro based on Scribe

* **[Google App Engine](https://github.com/cilogi/gaeshiro)** from [@cilogi](https://twitter.com/@cilogi)
Demo of one way to integrate Shiro with App Engine and Google Guice, plus front-end user registration and password management.

* **[Play!](https://github.com/wsargent/play-shiro)** from [@will_sargent](https://twitter.com/@will_sargent)
A very simple integration between Apache Shiro and Play 2.0. If you want to play with Play, this project could use an update handling statelessness since the Shiro 1.2 release. 

* **[55Wicket](https://github.com/55minutes/fiftyfive-wicket)** from [55 Minutes](http://www.55minutes.com/)
A nifty set of tools and libraries for enhancing productivity with the Apache Wicket Java web framework, including Shiro Integration.

* **[Lift](https://github.com/timperrett/lift-shiro)** from [@timperrett](https://twitter.com/@timperrett)
Integration between Shiro and the Lift Web framework. Uses Lift’s sitemap Locs instead of Shiro’s built in web.xml resource filters to control access to URLs.

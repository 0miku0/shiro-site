<h1><a name="JavaAnnotations-JavaAnnotationSupport"></a>Java Annotation Support</h1>
<p>Before you can use Java annotations, you'll need to enable AOP support in your application. There are a number of different AOP frameworks so, unfortunately, there is no standard way to enable AOP in an application.</p>

<p>For AspectJ, you can review our <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/apache/shiro/tree/master/samples/aspectj">AspectJ sample application</a>.</p>

<p>For Spring, you can look into our <a href="spring.html" title="Spring">Spring Integration</a> documentation.</p>

<h2><a name="JavaAnnotations-Shiro%27sJavaAnnotations."></a>Shiro's Java Annotations.</h2>
<p>Once you have AOP enabled in our application, you can use Shiro's set of annotations found in the <a href="java-annotations-list.html" title="Java Annotations List">Java Annotations List</a></p>

<p>While we hope this documentation helps you with the work you're doing with Apache Shiro, the community is improving and expanding the documentation all the time.  If you'd like to help the Shiro project, please consider corrected, expanding, or adding documentation where you see a need. Every little bit of help you provide expands the community and in turn improves Shiro. </p>

<p>The easiest way to contribute your documentation is to send it to the <a class="external-link" href="http://shiro-user.582556.n2.nabble.com/" rel="nofollow">User Forum</a> or the <a href="mailing-lists.html" title="Mailing Lists">User Mailing List</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="Issues-ApacheShiroBug%26IssueTracking"></a>Apache Shiro Bug &amp; Issue Tracking</h2>

<p>Apache Shiro uses Atlassian Jira for tracking  tasks, feature requests, bugs, and other issues related to the project development.</p>

<h2><a name="Issues-UsageGuidelines"></a>Usage Guidelines</h2>

<p>Jira is provided as a Shiro software development resource. It is meant to be for managing bugs, tasks and improvements in the software itself - it is not a support portal to ask for advice or help. For community advice and help in using Apache Shiro, please visit the <a href="support.html" title="Support">Support</a> page.</p>

<p><b>Prior to using Jira, we ask that:</b></p>
<ul><li>You do your due diligence to ensure a suspected error is actually a bug.</li><li>You search the issue tracker to ensure what you want to report has not already been reported by someone else.</li><li>If your problem is actually a bug, we would appreciate it if you could attach a simple JUnit test case that allows us to repeat the problem so we can fix it as fast as possible.</li><li>If a unit test is not available (please really try to make one!), attach a stack trace and Shiro's TRACE or DEBUG log output.</li><li>If you've already fixed the problem, please submit a patch and we'll likely include it in the next release.</li></ul>

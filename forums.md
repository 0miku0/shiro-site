#Apache Shiro Community Forums

For users that prefer to use forums over mailing lists, we use the [Nabble](http://www.nabble.com) forum/email/archive service. Nabble ensures that its forums remain synchronized with the mailing lists, so feel free to use whichever mechanism you like.

*   [Shiro Developer Forum](http://shiro-developer.582600.n2.nabble.com/)
